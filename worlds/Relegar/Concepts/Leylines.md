All across the world are leylines, currents of aether that flow unseen beneath the surface. Aether is present everywhere, but in the leylines it is heavily concentrated. Magic used in the presence of leylines can be amplified, or people with no magical training can replenish their aether as quickly as a trained wizard.

Leyline nodes are points along a leyline where the aether accumulates, providing a dense concentration of aether that often seeps up into the surface.

Leyline clusters are large leyline nodes where multiple leylines intersect.

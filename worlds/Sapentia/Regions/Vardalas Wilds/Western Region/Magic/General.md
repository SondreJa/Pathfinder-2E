Given the varying prevalence and attitudes towards magic in the different nations of this region, each nation has developed its own way of controlling and regulating the use of magic. Here's a brief overview of how each nation approaches magic:

1.  Veldaria: In Veldaria, magic is seen as a tool that can be used for the betterment of society, but its potential dangers are well recognized. The kingdom has established the Veldarian Arcane Academy, a prestigious institution where individuals with the talent and resources to learn magic can do so under the guidance of skilled and experienced instructors. The Academy also serves as a regulatory body that ensures the responsible use of magic within the kingdom. Those who misuse magic or practice forbidden arts are subject to punishment by the Academy's enforcers, the Arcane Wardens.
    
2.  Valtoros: Given the political instability and power struggles in Valtoros, magic is viewed with both awe and suspicion. The ruling authorities have established the Magisterium, a council of powerful mages who oversee the use of magic in the nation. The Magisterium tightly controls access to magical knowledge and resources, only allowing those who prove their loyalty and dedication to learn the art. Aspiring mages must pass rigorous tests and trials to gain the Magisterium's approval, and those who practice magic without authorization face severe penalties.
    
3.  Arganar: In the stratocracy of Arganar, magic is seen as a valuable asset for the military. The nation has formed the Arcane Division, a branch of the military that trains and employs skilled magic users. While magic is primarily used for combat and strategic purposes, the Arcane Division also works to regulate and control the use of magic in civilian life. Unauthorized use of magic, especially if it poses a threat to the nation's stability or security, is met with swift and severe consequences.
    
4.  Frostgarde: The Frostgarde Confederation, with its diverse city-states and cultures, has a more decentralized approach to magic regulation. Each city-state has its own magical institution or organization that oversees the use and control of magic within its borders. For example, Crystalshore may have a Mages' Guild that promotes responsible use of magic and offers training for aspiring mages, while Wolfswood relies on the Druidic Circle to manage the practice of magic on the island. Despite the differences in regulation, the city-states cooperate to address issues related to magic that affect the entire confederation.
    

Overall, while the nations in this region have different methods of controlling and regulating magic, they all share a common understanding of its potential dangers and the need for responsible use. This helps maintain a delicate balance between embracing the power of magic and ensuring its misuse doesn't threaten the stability and safety of their societies.

House Thornvale, ruling from the coastal city of Rilzathar, has a long history of overseeing the region's natural resources. Blessed with a rich forest to the south and a large river flowing from the mountains, Rilzathar has become a vital hub for logging and fishing industries. House Thornvale has carefully managed these resources, ensuring their sustainable use while generating substantial wealth and influence.

Lord Gavric Thornvale, the current head of the family, is a wise and patient ruler. He is known for his fairness and his devotion to the well-being of his people. Lord Gavric is married to Lady Annara Thornvale, an accomplished herbalist and healer who has made significant contributions to the medical knowledge of Veldaria. The couple has two children: Seraphine, a skilled archer and ranger who patrols the family's lands; and Tristan, a young scholar with a passion for the natural sciences.

House Thornvale's sworn protectors are the Greenwood Wardens, an elite force of skilled hunters and scouts who are experts in navigating the forests and hills surrounding Rilzathar. These wardens are responsible for maintaining the balance of the ecosystems, protecting the lands from poachers and bandits, and ensuring the safety of the region's inhabitants.

Though House Thornvale is not as politically powerful as some of the other noble families, they are highly respected for their expertise in resource management and their commitment to environmental preservation. Their sustainable practices have garnered admiration from across Veldaria and beyond, and their knowledge is often sought after by other noble houses looking to improve their own lands. House Thornvale has managed to maintain strong ties with the royal family and other noble houses, ensuring their continued status and influence within the kingdom.

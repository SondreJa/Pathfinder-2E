House Sylvereil, seated in the island city of Galendora, has a proud history of seafaring and trade. As rulers of Galendora, the Sylvereils have built a prosperous and well-defended city that serves as a vital link between Veldaria and other coastal nations. Their mastery of the sea has made them influential and wealthy, with a strong presence in the Veldarian navy and merchant fleets.

Lady Caelira Sylvereil, the current head of the family, is a shrewd and cunning leader with a keen mind for politics and trade. She has worked tirelessly to expand the influence and wealth of her family, negotiating lucrative trade deals and establishing a vast network of contacts across the seas. Lady Caelira is married to Lord Erevan Sylvereil, a skilled sailor and naval commander who has won many battles for Veldaria. Together, they have three children: Alaric, who is being groomed to inherit the lordship; Elira, a skilled diplomat and envoy; and young Yorin, who is showing great promise in naval tactics and navigation.

House Sylvereil's fleet, known as the Sea Serpents, is renowned for its speed and agility. These swift vessels, built in the shipyards of Galendora, are manned by experienced sailors and skilled navigators who can outmaneuver larger and slower enemy ships. The Sea Serpents also serve as the backbone of Veldaria's navy, patrolling the kingdom's coastal waters and protecting trade routes from pirates and other threats.

The Sylvereils have always maintained a delicate balance between their independence and their loyalty to the crown. While they have often used their wealth and influence to further their own interests, they have also consistently demonstrated their commitment to Veldaria's prosperity and security. This has allowed them to maintain their status as one of the most powerful and respected families in the kingdom, with strong connections to both the royal family and other influential noble houses.

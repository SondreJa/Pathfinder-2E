Veldaria, the largest and most influential nation among the four, is a well-established feudal monarchy. It boasts a rich history and a stable political system, with a single royal family maintaining their rule for centuries. The nation's landscape consists of fertile plains and lush valleys that support large-scale agriculture, providing Veldaria with the resources to sustain its population and military strength.

The capital city of Veldaria, Aelindar, is a majestic and well-fortified settlement built around a central palace, where the royal family resides. The palace's intricate architecture, adorned with the nation's emblem, stands as a symbol of Veldarian power and prestige.

The Veldarian society is hierarchical, with the royal family at the top, followed by various noble houses. These noble houses are in a constant struggle for influence, often engaging in political maneuvering and intrigue to win the favor of the royal family. They compete for titles, lands, and strategic marriages, but rarely challenge the royal family's authority directly.

Veldaria maintains a strong and disciplined military, which has played a crucial role in protecting its borders and asserting its dominance over neighboring nations. The nation's military tradition is deeply rooted in its history, with many of the noble families boasting a lineage of accomplished knights and commanders. Military service is held in high regard, with many young nobles seeking to make a name for themselves on the battlefield.

In recent times, Veldaria has focused on expanding its influence through diplomatic means, forging alliances and strengthening trade relations with other nations. Its alliance with Frostgarde serves as a vital counterbalance to Arganar's expansionist ambitions. The Veldarian economy benefits from the exchange of goods and resources with its allies, with its agricultural produce and skilled craftspeople being particularly sought after.

Despite the ongoing war with Arganar, Veldaria remains a bastion of stability and prosperity in the western Vardalas Wilds. The nation's rulers are keenly aware of the delicate balance of power in the region, and they are committed to preserving Veldaria's dominance while also maintaining peace and order within their borders.

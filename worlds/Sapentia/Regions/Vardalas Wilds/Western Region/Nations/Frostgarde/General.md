Frostgarde, located in the northwestern region of the continent, is a rugged and resilient federation of cities and towns, united in the face of potential threats from its more powerful neighbors. The nation's geography is characterized by its cold climate and challenging landscape, with the coastline providing the most hospitable areas for settlements to thrive. The southern part of Frostgarde, along the coast and the river that flows from the mountains to the east, hosts the majority of its population and larger settlements.

One of the key features of Frostgarde is its island to the west, which is considered part of the nation and houses a prominent city on its eastern coast. This city, known as Wolfswood, serves as a major trade and naval hub, as well as a center of cultural exchange. The island's strategic location has allowed Frostgarde to maintain a modest naval presence and safeguard its maritime interests.

Two other major cities lie on the mainland's coast, with one of them, Crystalshore, acting as the de facto capital of the federation. Riverreach is situated where the river from the mountains meets the coast, making it an important center for trade and transport, as well as the heart of the nation's political and administrative activities. The architecture in Crystalshore blends functionality with aesthetics, reflecting the city's pragmatic approach to governance and the appreciation of its natural surroundings.

Another prominent city, Timberfall, is located further up the river where most tributaries meet. Known for its resourceful and hardy population, Timberfall serves as a hub for resource extraction and trade with the mountainous regions to the east. The city has developed a reputation for its skilled craftsmen, particularly in metalworking and woodcarving.

The land in Frostgarde may not be as fertile as its southern neighbors, but it provides enough resources for the nation to sustain itself and grow. Fishing, forestry, and mining are the mainstays of its economy, with its people known for their adaptability and determination in the face of harsh conditions.

Frostgarde's political system is a federation ruled by a council of representatives from its various cities and towns. This structure allows for a degree of autonomy among its members while fostering cooperation and unity in the face of external threats. While not as wealthy as the other nations in the region, Frostgarde has managed to build strong ties with Veldaria, based on their common interest in opposing Arganar's expansionist ambitions. This alliance provides a level of security and stability for Frostgarde, as it seeks to maintain its independence and way of life in the challenging northern reaches of the continent.

Each of the city-states within the Frostgarde Confederation has its unique form of governance, reflecting their individual history, culture, and priorities. Here's an outline of how each city-state governs itself:

1.  Crystalshore: As the capital city-state and the most prosperous among the confederation, Crystalshore has a more centralized form of governance. A ruling council, known as the Crystal Council, is composed of prominent citizens from various sectors, including commerce, military, and the arcane arts. The council members are elected every four years, and the council selects a First Councilor from among themselves to lead the city and represent Crystalshore in the Frostgarde Confederation's national council. The current First Councilor is Lyanna Frostwind, a skilled diplomat and a respected trader.
    
2.  Timberfall: The city-state of Timberfall, located at the confluence of several tributaries, has a governance structure centered around the river and its resources. The city is governed by the River Assembly, a group of representatives chosen from the most prominent families and guilds in the city. These representatives are responsible for managing the city's affairs, such as trade, defense, and river management. The River Assembly selects a River Master, who serves as the head of the city-state and its representative on the national council. At present, the River Master is Eldric Riverstone, an experienced river navigator and timber merchant.
    
3.  Coldwater: Coldwater, situated along the western coast, is a city-state known for its strong naval tradition. The city is governed by the Admiralty, a council of experienced naval officers and influential shipwrights. The Admiralty oversees Coldwater's naval forces, harbor management, and maritime trade. The highest-ranking naval officer, known as the High Admiral, serves as the head of the city-state and represents Coldwater in the national council. High Admiral Alaric Frostwave, a seasoned naval commander and tactician, currently holds this position.
    
4.  Wolfswood: The city-state of Wolfswood, located on the eastern shore of the island to the west of the mainland, is heavily influenced by its proximity to the dense and mysterious woods. The governance of Wolfswood revolves around the Druidic Circle, a council of wise druids and elders who have a deep connection with the island's natural forces. The Circle is responsible for the city's environmental conservation, resource management, and spiritual well-being. The most senior member of the Druidic Circle, known as the Archdruid, serves as the head of the city-state and represents Wolfswood on the national council. Archdruid Maelis Whisperwood, a powerful and respected druid, is the current leader of Wolfswood.
    

While each city-state in Frostgarde has its distinct governance system, they all come together to form the Frostgarde Confederation's national council, where they discuss and make decisions on matters of national importance, ensuring the collective prosperity and security of the confederation.

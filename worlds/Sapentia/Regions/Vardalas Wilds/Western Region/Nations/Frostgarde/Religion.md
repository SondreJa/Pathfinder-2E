Religion in Frostgarde is a diverse mixture of beliefs and practices, with The Benevolent Wardens holding a significant presence in the region. However, given the unique nature of the city-states and their strong ties to the elements and natural world, other pantheons such as The Circle of Balance and The Primal Spirits have a larger following in some areas.

In Frostgarde, each city-state often has its own dominant religious practices, shaped by the local environment and culture. Some city-states may have a stronger connection to The Circle of Balance, with their citizens focused on maintaining harmony, equilibrium, and the cyclical aspects of life. In these places, deities such as Libra, Caelum, Lunara, and Chronus are revered and their temples can be found throughout the city.

Other city-states in Frostgarde may be more closely connected to The Primal Spirits, embracing the wild, untamed aspects of existence. In these regions, the people may have a deeper respect for the forces of nature and the raw power it embodies. Deities like Ferus, Sylvana, Tempestas, and Gaius would hold sway in these areas, and their followers would strive to live in harmony with the natural world, respecting its power and beauty.

Some of the independent gods may also be worshipped in Frostgarde, particularly those whose domains align with the harsh, cold environment or the city-states' specific cultures. For example, Elythra, the Goddess of Serenity and Frost, may be particularly revered in the colder regions, while Thalrina, the Goddess of Winter and Endurance, could be popular among those who face the challenges of Frostgarde's harsh climate.

The Benevolent Wardens still maintain a presence in Frostgarde, though their influence may be more subdued compared to other nations. Nevertheless, their teachings of peace, cooperation, and unity can still be found within the various city-states, and their followers work to promote these values even in the face of the region's challenges.

In summary, religion in Frostgarde is a complex blend of beliefs and practices, with The Benevolent Wardens, The Circle of Balance, The Primal Spirits, and various independent gods all having a presence in the region. The city-states' individual cultures and their relationship with the natural world heavily influence the dominant religious practices, creating a rich and diverse spiritual landscape for the people of Frostgarde.

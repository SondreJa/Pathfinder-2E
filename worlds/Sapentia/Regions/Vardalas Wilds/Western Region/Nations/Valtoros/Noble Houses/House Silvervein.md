House Silvervein is one of the most influential noble families in Valtoros, with a long history of wealth and power. The family's fortune comes from their control over several lucrative silver mines, which have provided them with the resources to maintain a strong presence in the kingdom's political landscape. Although House Silvervein has never ruled Valtoros, they have often played a key role in shaping the kingdom's direction through their strategic alliances and financial support of various factions.

The head of House Silvervein is Lady Mira Silvervein, a shrewd and calculating woman in her early fifties who is known for her cunning and ambition. She is a seasoned player in the game of politics and has a keen understanding of how to manipulate events in her favor. Her husband, Lord Galen Silvervein, is a skilled merchant with a vast network of contacts that stretches far beyond Valtoros, giving the family a strong presence in international trade.

Together, Lady Mira and Lord Galen have two children: Damien, the eldest, who is being groomed to take over the family business and political dealings; and Lysandra, a skilled alchemist who has shown a strong interest in expanding the family's influence in the arcane arts.

House Silvervein's seat of power is the opulent Silverhall, a sprawling estate located near the richest of their silver mines. The mansion is adorned with lavish decorations, including silver fixtures and intricate artwork, showcasing the family's immense wealth. Their crest features a silver pickaxe crossed with a merchant's scale, symbolizing their dedication to trade and mining.

Although House Silvervein has not yet held the throne, they have been able to exert considerable influence in Valtoros through their wealth and strategic alliances. Lady Mira has been quietly building support among other noble families and influential individuals, seeking an opportunity to challenge House Drakonhart's rule. To this end, House Silvervein has been known to engage in espionage, sabotage, and even assassination to undermine their rivals and advance their own interests.

In their quest for power, House Silvervein must navigate the delicate balance between ambition and caution. While they have many allies and resources at their disposal, they must also be wary of attracting too much attention or making too many enemies, as doing so could jeopardize their position and bring about their own downfall.

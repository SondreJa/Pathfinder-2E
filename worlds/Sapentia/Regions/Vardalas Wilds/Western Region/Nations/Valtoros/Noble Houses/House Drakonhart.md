House Drakonhart, the current ruling family of Valtoros, has a long and storied history in the kingdom. Their rise to power can be traced back several generations, as the family demonstrated their military prowess and strategic acumen on the battlefield. Over time, the Drakonharts gained the respect and support of many noble families and eventually claimed the throne.

The head of House Drakonhart, Lord Eldric Drakonhart, is a man in his late forties who exudes an aura of authority and determination. Having served in the military from a young age, he rose through the ranks quickly, proving himself as a capable leader and a skilled warrior. His strong military background has shaped his priorities as ruler, with a focus on expanding the kingdom's borders and strengthening its armed forces.

Lord Eldric is married to Lady Gwendolyn Drakonhart, a woman of grace and intelligence who serves as a trusted advisor to her husband. Together, they have three children: Alaric, the eldest and heir to the throne, who is currently training with the military; Evangeline, a talented diplomat and negotiator; and young Tristan, who shows a keen interest in the arcane arts.

Under the rule of House Drakonhart, Valtoros has seen a significant increase in military spending, with the construction of new forts, the expansion of the royal army, and the development of advanced weaponry. While some citizens and noble families view the Drakonharts as overly aggressive or even tyrannical, many others appreciate the stability and security their rule has brought to the kingdom.

House Drakonhart's stronghold, known as Dragon's Roost, is an imposing fortress situated atop a rocky hill. The castle is known for its formidable defenses and houses a vast armory filled with an impressive collection of weapons and armor. The family crest features a fierce dragon, symbolizing their martial prowess and unwavering determination to protect and expand the kingdom.

As the ruling family, House Drakonhart must navigate the complex web of politics and alliances within Valtoros. While they have their fair share of supporters, they also face opposition from other ambitious noble families seeking to claim the throne. In this ever-shifting landscape, the Drakonharts must rely on their military strength, strategic cunning, and the loyalty of their allies to maintain their grip on power.

Valtoros, nestled between the southern mountains and the vast Caelthor Woods, is a prosperous and influential elective monarchy. Although lacking direct coastal access, Valtoros has managed to establish vital trade routes through the mountains and neighboring Veldaria, connecting the northern and southern parts of the continent. This strategic position has allowed the nation to become a thriving hub of commerce and cultural exchange. Valtoros is known for its skilled artisans, resourceful traders, and diverse population, drawing people from all corners of the continent seeking fortune and opportunity.

The capital city of Valtoros, Glaevin, is a vibrant city located at the heart of the nation where several rivers from the northern mountains converge. The city is renowned for its beautiful architecture, with grand palaces and estates that reflect the wealth and status of the noble families who reside there. Glaevin also hosts an impressive array of markets, where goods from across the continent can be found. These markets contribute significantly to the nation's wealth and help maintain its reputation as an important trade center.

Due to the complex terrain surrounding the nation, the people of Valtoros have become adept at navigating the mountains and utilizing the resources provided by the Caelthor Woods. Lumber, minerals, and unique flora and fauna from the forest are some of the valuable resources that the nation exports. In return, Valtoros imports luxury goods, textiles, and other materials from the southern regions and beyond.

The political landscape of Valtoros is defined by the various noble families who compete for power and influence. When the reigning monarch dies, these families put forth their candidates, and an election is held to determine the next ruler. This system has led to a history of intrigue, alliances, and even assassinations, as ambitious families attempt to secure the throne for themselves. Despite this, the nation has managed to maintain a level of stability and avoid the chaos of civil war, as the noble families understand the importance of maintaining order in the face of potential threats from Veldaria and Arganar.

Valtoros' relationships with its neighboring nations are a delicate balancing act. While Veldaria and Valtoros share a strained relationship due to their proximity and competition for resources, Valtoros has not yet openly sided with Arganar in the ongoing conflict. This is primarily due to the longstanding animosity between Valtoros and Arganar, as well as the political machinations of the noble families vying for control within Valtoros itself. The nation's leaders are cautious about making any moves that could jeopardize their own power or the stability of their homeland.

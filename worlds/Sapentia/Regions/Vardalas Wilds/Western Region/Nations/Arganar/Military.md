In Arganar, the military holds the highest authority and serves as the backbone of the nation's governance. The structure of the Arganarian military is organized into several tiers, each with its specific responsibilities and roles.

1.  Supreme General: At the top of the hierarchy is the Supreme General, who serves as both the highest military authority and the head of state. The current Supreme General is General Karis Stormhand, an aggressive and ambitious leader responsible for declaring war on Veldaria. Stormhand's rule has been controversial, with rumors of an imminent replacement circulating regularly.
    
2.  Council of Generals: Reporting directly to the Supreme General is the Council of Generals, comprising the highest-ranking officers in the military. Each General commands a specific division or branch of the military and is responsible for advising the Supreme General on matters of war, defense, and military strategy. The Council of Generals also plays a role in selecting the next Supreme General when the position becomes vacant.
    
3.  Military Branches: Arganar's military is divided into several branches, each focusing on a specific area of warfare. These branches include the Infantry, Cavalry, Naval Forces, and Mage Corps. Each branch is commanded by a high-ranking General, who is a member of the Council of Generals.
    
4.  Regional Commanders: Beneath the branch Generals are Regional Commanders, responsible for overseeing the military presence within their assigned territories. They ensure the readiness of their troops, manage fortifications and defense structures, and coordinate with local governing bodies to maintain order and stability.

Arganar, situated on the coast between Veldaria to the south and Frostgarde to the north, is a formidable and ambitious stratocracy. The nation's landscape is primarily defined by the two major rivers that flow from the mountains, providing fertile land and abundant resources for the people of Arganar. The region between the rivers has become the heart of the nation, where most of its settlements and population are concentrated.

The capital city of Arganar, Ravencross, is located on the coast where the southern river meets the sea. Ironwatch is a well-fortified city, boasting impressive defensive structures and a strong naval presence. As a major port, it serves as a hub for trade and military operations, reflecting the nation's strategic priorities. The city's architecture is utilitarian, with strong stone buildings and wide streets to facilitate the movement of troops and supplies.

The nation's economy relies heavily on agriculture and fishing, as well as the rich mineral resources found in the mountains. Iron, in particular, is a valuable export, contributing to the nation's wealth and military prowess. Arganar's military is known for its disciplined soldiers, skilled tacticians, and advanced weaponry, a reflection of the nation's stratocratic government and martial values.

Arganar's political system is characterized by the rule of its military leaders, who wield significant power within the nation. The top general, who serves as the de facto ruler, is often replaced through internal military coups, leading to a constant ebb and flow between more aggressive and more peaceful rulers. The current general, known for their aggressive stance, declared war on Veldaria, but has failed to gain significant ground. As a result, the nation is now locked in a tense stalemate, with its borders heavily fortified and an atmosphere of uncertainty surrounding the general's rule.

Arganar's expansion has been limited by its neighboring nations and the challenging geography of the region. To the south, the no-man's land between Veldaria and Arganar serves as a natural barrier, making further territorial gains difficult. To the north, the nation has managed to extend its reach slightly beyond the northern river, but any further expansion would risk conflict with Frostgarde. This has led Arganar to focus on consolidating its power and influence within its current borders while seeking opportunities to tip the balance in its favor.

Arganar's relationships with its neighbors are complex and often strained. Its ongoing conflict with Veldaria has left the two nations in a state of hostility, with closed borders and fortified forts on both sides. Arganar's relationship with Valtoros is also tense, with a history of animosity preventing the formation of any meaningful alliances. Meanwhile, the nation maintains a cautious and watchful stance towards Frostgarde, recognizing the need to avoid provoking a conflict with the northern federation that could stretch its military resources too thin.

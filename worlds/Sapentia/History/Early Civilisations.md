## Elythria
Elythria was a highly advanced civilization with great knowledge in magic, architecture, and astrology. The people of Elythria worshipped the stars and were responsible for the initial formation of The First Pantheon. They believed that the gods of the pantheon resided in the celestial realm and wielded powers beyond human comprehension. Elythrians built great observatories and temples dedicated to these gods. Unfortunately, a catastrophic celestial event brought about the sudden destruction of Elythria, leaving behind only ruins and fragmented knowledge of their beliefs and discoveries. Elythria is said to have been located in Aeloria, as ruins of their civilisation can be found there, especially in the eastern regions.

## Valantar
Valantar was a coastal civilization known for its skilled seafarers and maritime traders. They worshipped the gods of The First Pantheon, who they believed granted them protection and prosperity on their ocean voyages. The Valantari were adept at shipbuilding and navigation, and their trade routes connected many parts of Sapientia. However, a series of devastating tsunamis and earthquakes led to the collapse of the Valantari civilization, submerging their cities beneath the waves and erasing much of their history. It is believe they were located somewhere on the southern coasts of Kalendria, but most of the traces of them are lost to the sea at this point, or crushed into the earth.

## Kharis
Kharis was a civilization nestled within a lush river valley, blessed with fertile soil and abundant resources in the jungles of northern Thulea. Agriculture played a significant role in the lives of the Kharisi, who believed that the gods of The First Pantheon granted them bountiful harvests. They built impressive temples and monuments dedicated to these gods, showcasing their artistic and architectural prowess. Sadly, a combination of drought, disease, and invasion brought about the demise of the Kharisi civilization. Their cities were abandoned, and nature eventually reclaimed the land, leaving only traces of their once-great society.

The Terrafoundry is a vast, labyrinthine network of caverns, tunnels, and immense geological formations. This plane was formed under the guidance of Terraxis, an Elder Being who embodies the essence of earth. Earth elementals, stone giants, and other beings of stone and mineral reside within this subterranean world. The Elemental Lord of Earth, a being of incredible strength and resilience, rules over the Terrafoundry, maintaining the balance of earth in the cosmos and serving as a conduit between the realm and Terraxis.

The Terrafoundry is an immense, ever-changing expanse of stone, crystal, and metal, where the primal essence of earth has shaped a labyrinthine network of caverns, tunnels, and vast subterranean chambers. The plane is a testament to the unyielding strength and resilience of the earth, with its towering mountains, vast chasms, and colossal crystal formations standing as monuments to the power of the element.

The landscape of the Terrafoundry varies from rugged badlands and windswept plateaus to dense forests of petrified trees and deep, echoing chasms that seem to stretch into infinity. Mineral-rich veins run through the rock, creating vibrant patterns and sparkling mosaics that catch the faint, ever-present glow of luminescent fungi and crystals.

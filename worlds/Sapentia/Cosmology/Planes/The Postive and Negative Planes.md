The Positive and Negative Planes are manifestations of the eternal struggle between two powerful Elder Beings, embodiments of opposing forces that permeate the multiverse. These planes are overflowing with raw energy, making them inhospitable to most forms of life. Despite their volatile nature, these planes play a crucial role in maintaining balance throughout the cosmos, as their energies influence and shape other planes of existence.

The Positive Plane is a realm of pure, radiant energy, a dazzling expanse of brilliant light and overwhelming life force. It is the domain of the positive Elder Being, Lumevera. Lumevera is a radiant, ever-shifting mass of light and energy, a being of creation and boundless vitality. She constantly emanates life-giving energy, fueling the growth and proliferation of life throughout the planes. Lumevera's very essence drives her to seek the destruction and absorption of her counterpart, the negative Elder Being.

The Negative Plane, on the other hand, is a dark and foreboding realm of entropy and decay, a place where light and life are extinguished by the all-consuming void. This plane is ruled by the negative Elder Being, Vorothis. Vorothis is a vast, undulating abyss of darkness and emptiness, a being of destruction and relentless consumption. He hungers for the annihilation of his counterpart, the positive Elder Being, seeking to consume her essence and plunge the cosmos into eternal darkness.

The eternal conflict between Lumevera and Vorothis maintains a delicate balance within the cosmos. As the energies of the Positive and Negative Planes bleed into other realms, they give rise to countless phenomena and shape the very fabric of existence. Their struggle is a dance of creation and destruction, light and darkness, life and death, defining the essential dichotomy that underlies all of reality.

Magic users and scholars throughout the planes have long sought to harness the energies of the Positive and Negative Planes, using them to fuel their spells and rituals. These energies can be both a source of great power and a dangerous, unpredictable force, depending on how they are wielded. Some may even seek to understand the true nature of the Elder Beings that govern these planes, hoping to gain insight into the fundamental forces that govern the universe.

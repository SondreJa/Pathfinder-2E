Nalathros was once a member of The First Pantheon, revered for their insatiable curiosity and vast intellect. Unlike their fellow deities, however, Nalathros became obsessed with uncovering the true nature of existence and the forces that lay hidden beyond the comprehension of even the gods.

Driven by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, Nalathros delved into the darkest secrets of the cosmos, seeking out the enigmatic Elder Beings that had birthed their world. Their relentless pursuit of understanding led them to the very edges of sanity, and the knowledge they gleaned from these incomprehensible entities began to erode their divine essence.

As Nalathros' understanding of the Elder Beings grew, so too did their madness. They became consumed by the revelations they uncovered, their once benevolent nature twisted into something unrecognizable. The divine power that had once granted Nalathros dominion over knowledge and wisdom was warped and corrupted, transforming them into the God of Forbidden Knowledge.

The other members of The First Pantheon were horrified by the fate that had befallen their once-great peer. In their efforts to contain the threat posed by Nalathros' newfound power and madness, the gods cast their fallen sibling out of the pantheon, banishing them to a hidden realm beyond the reach of mortals and gods alike.

In their exile, Nalathros continued to descend further into insanity, their shattered mind a reflection of the unfathomable truths they had uncovered. What remains of the deity now is a twisted, malevolent force, forever seeking to expand its knowledge of the Elder Beings and the dark secrets of existence.

The other deities, both those from The First Pantheon and those that came later, learned a harsh lesson from Nalathros' fall. They became wary of the dangers inherent in delving too deeply into the mysteries of the cosmos, and they now strive to maintain a delicate balance between their pursuit of knowledge and the preservation of their own divine sanity.

Nalathros serves as a cautionary tale for mortals and deities alike, a grim reminder of the perils of seeking forbidden knowledge and the consequences of reaching beyond the limits of comprehension.

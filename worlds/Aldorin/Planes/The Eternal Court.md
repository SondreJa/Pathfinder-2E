The Eternal Court is the plane where souls go to be shepherded, evaluated and judged in order to be sent to the correct plain where they belong. It was founded by [[The Judge]], the final arbiter of a soul's destiny, and is still watched over by them.

# Areas

The Eternal Court is more than just a simple court. It is a massive multi-structure consisting of several areas suited for different purposes. The courts themselves are split into three areas, The Court of Evaluations, The Court of Arbitrations and The Court of Primordials.

## The Courtyard
The first area most new arrivals visit is the Courtyard. The Courtyard is where [[the River Styx]]delivers newly departed souls, where they are met by Psychopomps who assist, inform, guide and watch over the new arrivals, while also detaining any who might try to escape their destiny. They also protect them from any that would try to steal away or destroy said souls. Being the central area of the Court, it is also where most planar visitors enter the plane.

## The Court of Evaluations
The first court that most souls go to is The Court of Evaluations. This is the court where souls that are either unclaimed or claimed without dispute go. For souls that are claimed without dispute, it is mostly a formality of getting the approval of a judge before they soul is delivered to their new plane. For souls that are unclaimed there will typically be several representatives from various planes that petition to both the judge and the soul. If they are able to convince the soul, and the judge does not contest it, the soul will go to that plane. If the soul is unable or uncaring enough to decide, the judge will make a decision. In many cases, there will be disputes over the soul that are unable to be solved by the judges here, typically just when there are two planes left, and in these cases the soul will be moved over to The Court of Arbitrations

## The Court of Arbitrations
The Court of Arbitrations is the court where souls that are disputed over go to. This either happens when the judge is unable to make a decision in The Court of Evaluations, or if a soul already has multiple claims to it before arriving in The Eternal Court. The Court of Arbitrations is split into several levels, eight in total, where if a judge is either unable to make a decision, or a judge agrees to the appeals of either a soul or the petitioners, then it will be moved to a higher level. There is technically a level after the eighth, where if the judge agrees with an appeal, the case is sent to The Judge themselves, but this has only happened four times in total, with each of these cases adding new clauses meant to prevent the same situation from happening again.

## The Court of Primordials
The Court of Primordials is the court that non-souls make use of. This can either be cases related to the soul judging that takes place in The Eternal Court itself, or for cases between planes themselves that are solved in a civil way. It is the least active of the courts, but still sees activity and has the most variety of denizens in it.

## The Eternal City
The Eternal City resides around the courts and courtyard, and is where the denizens of this plane reside should they be judged to travel here. It is a clean, orderly and well designed city.

# The Four Cases of The Judge
There have been a total of four cases where cases brought to the Eight Level of the Court of Arbitrations have not been able to be resolved there, and were brought before The Judge themselves. Each of these cases have resulted in new clauses to the laws of the The Eternal Court.

## The Reincarnation Clause
Though extremely few cases would ever reach the Eight Level of Arbitrations, there was a case by a soul so charismatic, so quick witted and full of resolve that was able to successfully appeal each of the levels, having started all the way back in The Court of Evaluations, and having reached the eight level with multiple petitioners from the planes. When the soul was brought in front of The Judge, they successfully argued their case that they had reached this level with multiple petitioners still vying for their soul, it must be too soon for the soul to be judged. The Judge agreed with this soul, and resolved to send the soul back to [[The Forge of Creations]] to be reborn anew, their soul still touched by their experiences, but with their memories and skills wiped. The Reincarnation Clause was added, and allowed the judges to reincarnate a soul if they found it clear that no decision could be made at this point.

The Judge is the ruler of [[The Eternal Court]], and the final arbiter of what the fate of a soul should be if there's otherwise unsolvable disputes.

## Appearance
The Judge is typically depicted in grandiose golden armour that fully covers their body, including their face. Their eyes are never depicted, as their helmet only has thin, dark openings. They are also typically depicted with their greatsword; a massive, silver and decorated hunk of metal. The most common pose is for them to sit in their throne in The Eternal Court, both hands resting on the pommel of their sword that rests in front of them. The Judge never takes on any typical gender roles in any depictions.

## Followers
Followers of The Judge are usually those who have a deep reverence for law and order, justice, and The Cycle of Souls.

The Judge is the ruler of [[The Eternal Court]], and the final arbiter of what the fate of a soul should be if there's otherwise unsolvable disputes.

## Appearance
The Judge is typically depicted in grandiose golden armour that fully covers their body, including their face. Their eyes are never depicted, as their helmet only has thin, dark openings. They are also typically depicted with their greatsword; a massive, silver and decorated hunk of metal. The most common pose is for them to sit in their throne in The Eternal Court, both hands resting on the pommel of their sword that rests in front of them. The Judge never takes on any typical gender roles in any depictions.

## Followers
Followers of The Judge are usually those who have a deep reverence for law and order, justice, and The Cycle of Souls. Those who work in governments or especially judicial courts, are likely to be followers of The Judge, as might many who work within law enforcement.

## Edicts and Anathema
Followers of The Judge should do their best to uphold the law and order, seek peaceful and legal solutions where possible, but not be afraid to fight to protect law, order and justice either. Followers should also do their best to support those who fight against immortals.

Followers should avoid breaking the law at all costs. If something is wrong with the law, it must be changed via judicial means. Never use violence as a first solution if peaceful manners are viable. 

## The Divine Executioners
The Divine Executioners is a dedicated branch of followers to The Judge, whose main purpose is to hunt down and execute those who seek to avoid the Cycle of Souls by becoming immortal. Immortals in this case only encompass those who seek true immortality, as someone who simply slows down their rate of ageing will eventually reach The Cycle, and what might seem like aeons to mortals might be as the blink of an eye to the ancient primordials.

Members of this divine order are those who have typically gone above and beyond to prove both their devotion towards The Judge, but also have shown exceptional martial or magical skills, as hunting down immortals is not an easy task.

Divine Executioners are typically recognised by their tabards that show a silver greatsword enveloped by golden flames. They also wear golden masks that hide their faces when on duty. They are a rare sight

The Watcher is the eternal entity who watches over The Inner Planes. To many they are an enigmatic entity, because as far as history can go, they have never shown any motivation towards specific goals, only observing.

## Appearance
The Watcher is typically depicted as a giant hand with an eye in the centre, which is also their symbol. What the hand looks like varies a lot, typically depending on the culture and heritages of the region the depiction is made. Some depictions have a very plain hand with a simple eye, while others might be extremely decorated, or have text inscribed into the hand meant to symbolise all they have observed.

## Followers
Despite being an ancient deity, they aren't the most popular of gods for most commoners. However those who do follow them are often information brokers, journalists, spies or others who are in the information business one way or the other.

## Edicts and Anathema
The most important edict for followers is to gather information and observe happenings, but to never interfere on them. The most devout of their followers would go so far as even should a murder occur right in front of them, they should not interfere in it. But at the same time, they would have no issues handing records of the happening over to law enforcement right after.

Anathema to The Watcher would be to falsify information, or to change outcomes for personal gain. While it's not anathema to prevent a law from being broken in front of them, devout followers would say that their duty is simply to observe and record, not interfere or participate.

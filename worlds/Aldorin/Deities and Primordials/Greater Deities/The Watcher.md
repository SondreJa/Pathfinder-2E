The Watcher is the eternal entity who watches over The Inner Planes. To many they are an enigmatic entity, because as far as history can go, they have never shown any motivation towards specific goals, only observing.

## Appearance
The Watcher is typically depicted as a giant hand with an eye in the centre, which is also their symbol. What the hand looks like varies a lot, typically depending on the culture and heritages of the region the depiction is made. Some depictions have a very plain hand with a simple eye, while others might be extremely decorated, or have text inscribed into the hand meant to symbolise all they have observed.

## Followers
Despite being an ancient deity, they aren't the most popular of gods for most commoners. However those who do follow them are often information brokers, journalists, spies or others who are in the information business one way or the other.

## Edicts and Anathema
The most important edict for followers is to gather information and observe happenings, but to never interfere on them. The most devout of their followers would go so far as even should a murder occur right in front of them, they should not interfere in it. But at the same time, they would have no issues handing records of the happening over to law enforcement right after.

Anathema to The Watcher would be to falsify information, or to change outcomes for personal gain. While it's not anathema to prevent a law from being broken in front of them, devout followers would say that their duty is simply to observe and record, not interfere or participate.

## The Panopticon
The Panopticon is a group of devout followers who are dedicated to gathering, cataloguing and distributing information. It is common for the larger cities of the world to have a Panopticon Library, a combination of library and temple to The Watcher. They have librarians with vast knowledge over what information they have stored, what is considered dangerous and classified and if they don't have something, they might often know if another library has access to it. However their members aren't limited to just librarians and scribes, but spies, journalists and observers are included in their ranks too.

Members of the Panopticon are typically signified with a dark cloth cowl that is wrapped around their head and mouth, with an eye embroidered into the part of the cloth that goes over the forehead.

There are many ranks within The Panopticon. One of these is The Speaker, who is among other roles given to those who front the different Libraries. Their cowl has a design that shows their mouth, designating their permission to speak about the information they have gathered.

Another rank is The Observer. Though there are many non-Observers who gather information for the order, Observers are those who have shown both skill and devotion, and are given important and sacred roles. An Observers uniform is modified in a way that reveals their forehead where they will have an eye tattooed on instead. Observers are sometimes given the roles of spies, but often will be given the role of observing major events, such as wars, negotiations between powers and the like. It is considered a grave sin to murder an Observer, and the act of doing so will get the responsible sent The Hands after them. Though it is often much secrecy surrounding an Observer, so if one is seen in a place, that is often a sign that something significant has or will happen there.

The Hand is a special rank of the enforcers of The Panopticon. Due to them gathering and storing so much information, much that is both valuable and dangerous if put into the wrong hands, they take responsibility to store and protect it. This is where the Hands come in, and their uniform is modified so that the eye on the forehead of their cowl is a closed fist instead. These are also the members who are sent after those who kill an Observer.

The Age of Divinities is the earliest of recorded world ages, when the deities and other primordials interacted closely and tightly with the mortal world. Mortals who appealed to the deities could get direct visits from the deity, and the powers granted were powerful and widespread. This age would be marked by several powerful nations and empires that were wide stretched thanks to the divine powers granted to the mortals, that made transportation, food, resources and communication easy and abundant. The biggest challenges to expanding further were usually very hostile environments and bordering empires.

# Central Faelondor
Central Faelondor was primarily defined by three empires. Believed to be the first of many empires was The Golden Empire, that would stretch from the western coasts of Central Faelondor to the eastern coasts. However at some unknown time in history, much of the empire was lost, or rather taken over from within, from followers of Malphasar, who would turn the eastern half into The Empire of Perdition. However in the very central mountains of this region lies a circular valley of a rain forest, where the Rhaduum Dynasty lies. Safely nestled within the mountains, any attempt from outsider to conquer the valley would easily be pushed back.
